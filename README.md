# Purdy-Tua
The perception of Brock Purdy and Tua Tagovailoa is they're just average quarterbacks.  They are described as "dink-and-dunk" QBs because it's said they can just dump the ball off around the line of scrimmage to explosive playmakers like Deebo Samuel and Tyreek Hill and let them turn short passes into long gains and lengthy touchdowns, hence "making the QBs look better than they truly are."  However, when I started analyzing air yard statistics, which tell how effective a QB is the further their passes travel beyond the line of scrimmage, I realized that a false perception of these two QBs has been created just because they have great players around them.  

See Python notebook for analysis.
